### `Latest`
# **Version 1.4**
Version 1.4 implements some mandatory changes to keep the app compliant with the Apple and Google platforms as well as to utilise the latest version of some internal libraries it makes use of.
In addition it adds the ability to mark notes as favourites, and to filter the notebook to only show favourites to make them faster to find.

#### What's New

- Updated the Google Admob SDK to the latest version to remain compliant.

# **Version 1.3**
In the initial version of **Air Fryr** I included the ability to add categories to any notes that you save, and now in this latest release I actually allow you to make use of those categories, by quickly filtering the notebook to show only the selected category - perfect if you want to quickly find a list of all the dessert recipes you've saved!

#### What's New
- Added the ability to filter the notebook by category.
- Implemented a 'what's new' pop-up that displays when the app version updates.

### **Version 1.2**

#### What's New
- Added the ability to support the app and remove ads via an in-app purchase.

### **Version 1.1**
In the second app release I've made it easier to manage an ever growing notebook by including a real time search feature - simply begin typing the name of a note into the search box and the notebook will filter down to show notes matching the search criteria.
In addition this update includes a link in the sidebar to take you directly to the App Store/Play Store to leave an app review - reviews really help to surface the app to new users as well as being a great way to tell me what you do and don't like about the app, so please consider sharing your thoughts (good or bad!)

#### What's New
- Added ability to search notebook
- Added direct link to leave app reviews
- Updated validation on note fields

### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0**
The initial release of **Air Fryr!**
**Air Fryr** has been built as a companion app for those looking to get the most out of their air fryer. It allows users to convert the oven cooking times provided in recipes/on packet instructions to timings more suitable for an air fryer, as well as to save these calculations to a notebook for future reference, or amendment (as rule of thumb calculatios aren't always perfect, and everybodies machine is a little different).

#### Key Features
- Calculate reduced cooking temperature & time for Air Frying vs conventional ovens
- Switch preference between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Save notes for future reference
- Edit saved notes
