# Changelog
Here you can view a changelog and version history for **Air Fryr.**
Got some suggestions for features you'd like to see in a future update? Please feel free to mention in an app review via Apple or Google, or drop me an email!

### `Latest`
# **Version 1.3**
In the initial version of **Air Fryr** I included the ability to add categories to any notes that you save, and now in this latest release I actually allow you to make use of those categories, by quickly filtering the notebook to show only the selected category - perfect if you want to quickly find a list of all the dessert recipes you've saved!

#### What's New
- Added the ability to filter the notebook by category.
- Implemented a 'what's new' pop-up that displays when the app version updates.


<br>

### **Version 1.2**
In this release I've added the ability to remove the ads from **Air Fryr** through a simple in-app payment. Users can choose the price they want to pay to support the app and permanently remove ads.

#### What's New
- Added the ability to support the app and remove ads via an in-app purchase.
- Updates to add additional options and clearer navigation in the sidebar menu

### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0**
The initial release of **Air Fryr!**
**Air Fryr** has been built as a companion app for those looking to get the most out of their air fryer. It allows users to convert the oven cooking times provided in recipes/on packet instructions to timings more suitable for an air fryer, as well as to save these calculations to a notebook for future reference, or amendment (as rule of thumb calculatios aren't always perfect, and everybodies machine is a little different).

#### Key Features
- Calculate reduced cooking temperature & time for Air Frying vs conventional ovens
- Switch preference between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Save notes for future reference
- Edit saved notes
